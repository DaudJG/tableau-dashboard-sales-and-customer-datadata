The purpose of this project was to create an interactive, visually compelling dashboard that allows stakeholders to monitor key business metrics at a glance. The dashboard provides a high-level overview of company performance and includes detailed breakdowns of sales and profit by subcategories like **Accessories, Appliances, Binders, and more**. The goal is to enable efficient, data-driven decision-making through a simple yet powerful interface.

- **Sales & Profit by Subcategory:** A side-by-side comparison of sales and profit/loss per subcategory for 2022.
- **Weekly Trend Analysis:** Visualizes sales and profit fluctuations throughout the year, highlighting trends and seasonality.

## Process
### Step 1: Miro Mockup
Before building the Tableau dashboard, I designed a mockup in Miro to outline the layout and functionality of the dashboard. This allowed me to plan the structure of the dashboard, ensuring that all essential metrics and visualizations would be included.

### Step 2: Tableau Development
Using the mockup as a guide, I developed the Tableau dashboard. The project involved data cleaning, metric calculations, and creating interactive features to allow users to explore the data in detail.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to create user-friendly, dynamic Tableau dashboards for business analytics. The visualizations and interactivity were designed to allow business stakeholders to quickly access key metrics and dive deeper into specific areas when needed.
